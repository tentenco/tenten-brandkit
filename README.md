Several logo variations are provided for different purposes. The logo in blue and dark grey should be used with light background and make sure it's contrastive enough to distinguish. If you require a different format of the logo, please edit on Tenten Logo Figma.

### Logo files 
<ul>
<li>Logos in blue, white, and full color variants in both PNG and SVG format.</li>
<li>White versions of the logos should be used in media with dark backgrounds.</li>
<li>The one without "tenten" can be used separately when it's too tight to put the complete logo.</li>
</ul>

### Extended Logo

Tenten's logo is flexible, there are two extended logos for tenten.agency and tenten.blog now. They're used to represent tenten's service and culture. The logo can be extended by adding services name after "tenten".
