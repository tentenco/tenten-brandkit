# Tenten Brand Guidelines

## Logos
The Tenten brand consists of the main Tenten logo, and several variations which are associated with different projects.

### Logo variations
Several logo variations are provided for different purposes. The logo in blue and dark grey should be used with light background and make sure it's contrastive enough to distinguish. If you require a different format of the logo, please contact inquiry@tenten.co.

### Logo files 
<ul>
<li>Logos in blue, white, and full color variants in both PNG and SVG format.</li>
<li>White versions of the logos should be used in media with dark backgrounds.</li>
<li>The one without "tenten" can be used separately when it's too tight to put the complete logo.</li>
</ul>

## Color Palette
Our primary color is Blue and the dark blue. This is to create a premium digitally, technical feel as the tentenâ€™s professional and the driving innovation faster.
